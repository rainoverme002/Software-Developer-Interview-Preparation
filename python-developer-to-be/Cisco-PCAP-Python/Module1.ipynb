    "## Python Essentials: Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- A program written in a high-level programming language is called a source code (in contrast to the machine code executed by computers). Similarly, the file containing the source code is called the source file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Computer Works?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A program makes a computer usable. Without a program, a computer, even the most powerful one, is nothing more than an object\n",
    "\n",
    "### Natural languages vs. programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Natural : Normal Human Language\n",
    "- Programming : Machine Language\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Makes a Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "AN ALPHABET\n",
    "- a set of symbols used to build words of a certain language (e.g., the Latin alphabet for English, the Cyrillic alphabet for Russian, Kanji for Japanese, and so on)\n",
    "\n",
    "A LEXIS\n",
    "- (aka a dictionary) a set of words the language offers its users (e.g., the word \"computer\" comes from the English language dictionary; the word \"chat\" is present both in English and French dictionaries, but their meanings are different)\n",
    "\n",
    "A SYNTAX\n",
    "- a set of rules (formal or informal, written or felt intuitively) used to determine if a certain string of words forms a valid sentence (e.g., \"I am a python\" is a syntactically correct phrase, while \"I a python am\" isn't)\n",
    "\n",
    "SEMANTICS\n",
    "- a set of rules determining if a certain phrase makes sense (e.g., \"I ate a doughnut\" makes sense, but \"A doughnut ate me\" doesn't)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What programming language need?\n",
    "\n",
    "Alphabetically\n",
    "- a program needs to be written in a recognizable script, such as Roman, Cyrillic, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lexically\n",
    "- each programming language has its dictionary and you need to master it; thankfully, it's much simpler and smaller than the dictionary of any natural language;\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntactically\n",
    "- each language has its rules and they must be obeyed;\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantically\n",
    "- the program has to make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compilation vs. interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "COMPILATION\n",
    "- the source program is translated once (however, this act must be repeated each time you modify the source code) by getting a file (e.g., an .exe file if the code is intended to be run under MS Windows) containing the machine code; now you can distribute the file worldwide; the program that performs this translation is called a compiler or translator\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pro:\n",
    "    - the execution of the translated code is usually faster;\n",
    "    - only the user has to have the compiler - the end-user may use the code without it;\n",
    "    - the translated code is stored using machine language - as it is very hard to understand it, your own inventions      - and programming tricks are likely to remain your secret.\n",
    "- Cons:\n",
    "    - the compilation itself may be a very time-consuming process - you may not be able to run your code immediately after any amendment;\n",
    "    - you have to have as many compilers as hardware platforms you want your code to be run on.\n",
    "\n",
    "INTERPRETATION\n",
    "- you (or any user of the code) can translate the source program each time it has to be run; the program performing this kind of transformation is called an interpreter, as it interprets the code every time it is intended to be executed; it also means that you cannot just distribute the source code as-is, because the end-user also needs the interpreter to execute it\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pro:\n",
    "    - you can run the code as soon as you complete it - there are no additional phases of translation;\n",
    "the code is stored using programming language, not the machine one - this means that it can be run on computers using different machine languages; \n",
    "    - you don't compile your code separately for each different architecture.\n",
    "- Cons:\n",
    "    - don't expect that interpretation will ramp your code to high speed - your code will share the computer's power with the interpreter, so it can't be really fast;\n",
    "    - both you and the end user have to have the interpreter to run your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does the interpreter actually do?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using \"read-check-execute\" schema for each line, and stop immediately when it find error"
