"instance variable with @,eg: @test or @id is used because the normal variable is cannot stay outside the function itself, and the instance variable can stay in the class"

example:

class CoffeeMachine
  def initialize
    @water = 100
  end
  def make_coffee
    @water -= 10
  end
end

"the @water will be 100 if we create new CoffeMachine"
